### Information.
As seen in figures 1 and 2, there is a clear bais towards the minimum CDK consensus sequence (S/T-P) with some preference to the full CDK consensus sequence (S/T-P-X-R/K-R/K-R/K). Upstream of the phosphorlation sites there increased frequency of lysine residues similar to Auroa B consensus sequence (K-X-S-I/L/V) and CDK1 minimum non-cosensus sequence (S/T-X-X-R/K) but not the full non-canonical consensus sequence P-X-S/T-X-R/K-R/K). Additionally, glutamate residues were also enriched downstream similar to the Plk minimum consensus sequence (D/E-X-S/T). However, hydrophobic residues upstream of the phospohorylated serine/theronine were uncommon in the sequences. The lysine residues down stream could also be a result a tendancy of having of cyclin binidng motifs such as the Cy motif (R/K-X-L), although the luecine residues tended to not to be enriched in the sequences.

Here is some basic data analysis of the titanic dataset. A normal distribution of the ages (figure 1). A histogram of the fares (figure 2). A pie chart of where the passenagers embarked (figure 3). . Figure 4 .
